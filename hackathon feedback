Pokemon Game
I really liked the features that you added to your project, like managing users, filtering  and the game itself
you did alot in a really short time, well done
Regarding the implementaion I see that you splitted the code as we discuss but you can split you code into more function and user more 
meanangful names instead of my_functions.py

Fantastic job!!
